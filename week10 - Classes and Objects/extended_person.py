Solution of task 10.3 - Extending Person Class:
Your job is to modify the constructor in such a way, that the person's
 address will also be saved as an attribute of the object.
Also, implement the method move which can be used to change the person's
 address when he moves into a new apartment, house etc.
Finally, update the printout method so that when the given main is
  exceuted the information printed will look like:


Learning Goals:
 I will practise adding methods and attributes to a class.
